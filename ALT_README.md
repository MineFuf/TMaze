So, here’s the deal – TMaze chucks you into a right brain-boggler of a maze. It’s lightweight, works across platforms, and it don’t care if your laptop’s older than your nan’s tea set – it’ll still run a treat.

### Top Features, Bruv:

- **Customizable Mazes**: You can make these bad boys as big or as small as you fancy – set the size, pick the colours, and crack on.
- **Random Mazes**: You got a few classic algorithms like Kruskal’s and Depth-First Search – proper techy stuff, that.
- **Time Your Moves**: Fancy a challenge? There’s a timer and a move counter, so you can see how quick you can leg it through the maze.
- **Spectator Mode**: Feel like having a butcher’s at the whole map? You can fly ‘round and check out the entire layout. Perfect for showing off down the pub.

The developer – top bloke – needed a bit of fun during lectures, and he fancied giving **Rust** a whirl. So what’s better than whipping up a cheeky maze-solving game, eh? Something dead lightweight that’ll run anywhere – even on a server while you’re doing nowt else.
